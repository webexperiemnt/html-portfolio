<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. This is me. I'm Labib. I'm a basic learner and explorer. I like to explore a lot. I also like travelling.</p>

<p>I was born in March 13th, 2004. So it means I'm only 20 years old. In my childhood, I used to be scared of ghosts. In my early 20's, this entire esoteric thing thrills me a lot. Like a lot! I'm not a ghost hunter or anything like that.</p>

<p>I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in bachelor of Computer Science And Engineering. Within the next 5 years I hope, I'll focus on being a computer engineer.</p>
